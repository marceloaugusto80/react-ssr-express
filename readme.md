### Instalation
1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/marceloaugusto80/react-ssr-express.git`
2. Install dependencies: 
``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Usage

Use one of the following commands:
* run server in watch mode:
``` bash
$ npm run start:server
```
* run client app in dev server with Hot Reload:
``` bash
$ npm run start:client
```
* build the application for production:
``` bash
$ npm run build:prod
```
* test:
``` bash
$ npm test
```

#### Compilation output
After compilation, all output will be available in the `./dist` folder. The server logic will be bundled in the `./dist/app.js` file and client assets will be in the `./dist/public/` folder.

### Client vs Server side branching
The global variable `__SERVER__` will be set to `true` if the code was compiled to target the server (Node) environment. Otherwise, it will have a value of `false`.

### Prerendered data
Check the following modules to see how server side data are passed to the prerendered dom:
```
./src/shared/PrerenderData.ts
./src/client/serverData.ts
```
The examples how to use these modules are in:
```
./src/server/routing.ts
./src/client/pages/SamplePage1.tsx
```
